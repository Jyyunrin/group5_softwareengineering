Testing the camera on your mobile phone

Make sure your computer and phone are on the same network

Run npx vite --host

Vite will display Network URL ex. http://192.168.x.x:5173/

Open this URL on your phone browser

If computer has multiple network interfaces, look for the Wifi interface IPv4 address

Optional firewall step if phone cannot reach computer: add an inbound rule for TCP port 5173 for your firewall and ensure your network allows for local connections
